Goal:
Build a production reliability & cost intelligence platform
that reduces alert noise, improves incident response time,
and balances reliability with infrastructure cost.

Core Metrics:
- Alert noise %
- MTTA / MTTR
- SLO compliance
- Estimated infra cost

Constraints:
- Solo project
- Local Kubernetes (Minikube) / EKS 
- Simulated production load
